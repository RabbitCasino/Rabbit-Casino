## The provably fair system

### Random numbers

The system uses random numbers to generate games. A random number is a number chosen by chance, randomly, from a set of numbers. All the numbers in a specified distribution have equal probability of being chosen randomly.
Each single game has its own way of calculating the outcome from a given random number explained in detail on the game's page.

### Salt and pepper

Salt and pepper... this is our recipe for demonstrating the correctness of the draws and the impossibility of deceiving the player by the system.

Before you play any game, the system prepares a secret random number and calculates its digital signature. For security reasons you cannot know the exact number but you can always see its digital signature (or hash). The generated random number is kept hidden until it is used, i.e. until you decide to play a game.

These rules ensures that:
- the random number whose digital signature you can see is the only number that the system can use to generate the next game
- the random number remains the same whichever game you choose, this guarantees the neutrality of the chosen number towards games
- it is impossible for the system to use any random number other than the one already drawn; in order to do this, the system would have to find another number whose digital signature exactly matches the one displayed to the player... that's impossible.

## Playing modes

You can play games in 2 ways: fun play or real play.

### Fun play
If you're not logged in or your account has not been activated yet you can only play fun mode: games use fake credits so you can explore games features safely.

### Real play
When you log in and your account is activated games start using real credits. Certainly you can go back to playing fun mode by logging out.

Games automatically switch modes according to your account state and login.
Games always warn you if you are playing fun or real.

## Play safe

Playing at Rabbit casino should always be considered as a way of exciting pass time, not a way of making money.
Do you want to make joy and happiness last the longest possible? Just pick the minimum bet size. Avoid chasing losses, there is always another day.
